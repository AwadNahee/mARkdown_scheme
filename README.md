The main goal of **OpenITI mARkdown** is to provide a simple system for tagging structural, morphological and semantic elements in premodern and early modern Islamicate texts of the [OpenITI corpus](https://github.com/OpenITI). The use of **OpenITI mARkdown** will allow one to engage in the computational analysis of texts in the same way as allowed by the more complex and time-consuming tagging schemes such as TEI XML; **OpenITI mARkdown** will also facilitate the conversion of the large volume of Islamicate texts into TEI XML, which is now the standard format for digital editions. In principle, **OpenITI mARkdown** does not require any special editor, but the current implementation relies on [EditPad Pro](https://www.editpadpro.com/), which supports right-to-left languages, Unicode, and large files. However, it is the support of custom highlighting and navigation schemes that makes this text editor particularly convenient for **OpenITI mARkdown**.
